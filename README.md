# Jungle Devs - Design Challenge #001

  ## Description
  **Challenge goal**: To start creating some great experiences, you first need to dominate the tool, so nothing will stop you! In this challenge, you will start learning how to use Figma, a powerful tool to create your designs. You'll be introduced to the usage of some basic tools, like grids, layers styles, text styles, iconography and other design fundamentals. Each design element has a purpose and meaning - so let's dig into them! ðŸŒˆ
  
  **Target level**: This is an entry level course, so no prior knowledge of design is needed. If you already played with any design editor before (even Paint counts ðŸ˜„ ), you're more than ready to start this challenge!
  
  **Final accomplishment**: At the end of this challenge, you will have a basic grasp of how Figma works, how to work with its basic tools and how to apply layer and text styles.
