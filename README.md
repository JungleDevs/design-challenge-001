# Jungle Devs - Design Challenge #001

  ## Description
  **Challenge goal**: To start creating some great experiences, you first need to dominate the tool, so nothing will stop you! In this challenge, you will start learning how to use Figma, a powerful tool to create your designs. You'll be introduced to the usage of some basic tools, like grids, layers styles, text styles, and basic prototyping reproducing four screens from a product.
  
  **Target level**: This is an entry level course, so no prior knowledge of design is needed. If you already played with any design editor before (even Paint counts ðŸ˜„ ), you're more than ready to start this challenge!
  
  **Final accomplishment**: At the end of this challenge, we will be able to create your designs using text styles, color styles, layouts, grids and showcase them with simple prototypes.
